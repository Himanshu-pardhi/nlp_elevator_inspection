# Imbalnce Multiclass Text Classification using Machine Learning Model


### Description  
This project is implemented based on Machine learning Model. Using a LinearSVC classifier to predict the correct class for the text given.    

### Repo structure  
* `nlp.ipynb`: jupyter notebook file which has scripts and instructions on exploring the dataset, preprocessing, identifying the models and       training them
* `functions.py`: All functions used to implement the `nlp.ipynb`.
* `app.py`: Scripts of streamlit application for deploying the model.
